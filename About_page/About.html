            <h3>Kallen O'Connor</h3>
            <p>A native of Columbus, Georgia, Kallen O'Connor began her violin
                 studies at age eight. Growing up, she was involved in many of the arts 
                 including music, dance, and theater. In May 2015, 
                 Kallen graduated as Valedictorian with a Bachelor of Music degree 
                 in violin performance from the Cleveland Institute of Music under the tutelage of 
                 Stephen Rose. The following year, she completed her studies at CIM as a joint student 
                 of William Preucil and Stephen Rose earning her Master of Music degree in May of 2016. 
                 Kallen has been a member of the first violin section of the Akron Symphony Orchestra 
                 since 2015. She is a member of the band Emily & Ivory and currently resides in
                  Southwest Ohio with her husband, Sean and their Siamese cat, Chloe.</p>

                <i>"Kallen is the one of the very best musicians I have ever worked with. 
                     She is a true professional not only in her preparation level, her ability to collaborate and her engaging performance presence. 
                     She has a beautiful sound and an awesome technique. It has been my pleasure to work with her for many live performances and recording projects.
                      Her ability to improvise as well as meticulously read difficult materials, make her a valued member of any ensemble or project one needs a superior 
                      violinist who is also a fantastic musician." </i>

                She not only plays beautifully and has a great attitude, but she intuitively gets what you're looking for - 
                the stuff that can't be written down or easily described. She is a phenomenal musician (and a great singer too, if you need that!) 
                and always strives to attain the highest quality possible in everything she does. Hire her - you will be thrilled that you did!"</i>
