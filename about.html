                <h3>Kallen O'Connor</h3>
                <p>
                    A native of Columbus, Georgia, Kallen O'Connor began her violin
                    studies at age eight. Growing up, she was involved in many of the arts
                    including music, dance, and theater. In May 2015,
                    Kallen graduated as Valedictorian with a Bachelor of Music degree
                    in violin performance from the Cleveland Institute of Music under the tutelage of
                    Stephen Rose. The following year, she completed her studies at CIM as a joint student
                    of William Preucil and Stephen Rose earning her Master of Music degree in May of 2016.
                    Kallen has been a member of the first violin section of the Akron Symphony Orchestra
                    since 2015. She is a member of the band Emily & Ivory and currently resides in
                    Southwest Ohio with her husband, Sean and their Siamese&nbsp;cat,&nbsp;Chloe.

                    "I've worked with Kallen countless times, and it has always been pure joy.
                    She not only plays beautifully and has a great attitude, but she intuitively gets what you're
                    looking for -
                    the stuff that can't be written down or easily described. She is a phenomenal musician (and a great
                    singer too, if you need that!)
                    and always strives to attain the highest quality possible in everything she does. Hire her - you
                    will be thrilled that you&nbsp;did!"

                <p>
                    "Kallen is the one of the very best musicians I have ever worked with.
                    She is a true professional not only in her preparation level, her ability to collaborate and her
                    engaging performance presence.
                    She has a beautiful sound and an awesome technique. It has been my pleasure to work with her for
                    many live performances and recording projects.
                    Her ability to improvise as well as meticulously read difficult materials, make her a valued member
                    of any ensemble or project one needs a superior
                    violinist who is also a fantastic musician."
